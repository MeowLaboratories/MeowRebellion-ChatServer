# Meow Rebellion (Chat Server System)

The Meow Rebellion is a chat server and client system that will allow you to chat with multiple users at real time. Anyone who is a Meow Rebel 
(user) can log in at any time and talk to other Meow Rebels. Anybody wishing to become a Meow Rebel can sign up for the Rebellion using the
client software. A list of all Meow Rebels online is shown in a sidebar, and chat history can be saved with just a click of a button.

## Getting Started

The server system, Meow Rebellion, saved in the ChatServer folder is compiled into a .jar file that will run in a server with real IP connection. The server's 
IP address and port number is fixed and they are - IP: 103.84.159.230 and PORT: 5000. The Meow Rebellion runs without break in the server, so Meow rebels
do not have to worry about the Rebellion server being down nor need to enter any IP address or port number. The .jar file can be found in the 
ProjectNetworking/ChatServer/dist/ directory.
The client system, Meow Client, saved in the ChatClient folder is compiled into a .jar file that will allow the Meow Rebels to run the client system 
just by running the file. Meow Rebels will then be able to enter the Rebellion by giving credentials and being authenticated by the system.
The .jar file can be found in the 
ProjectNetworking/ChatClient/dist/ directory.
